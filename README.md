# Project: Crack the Hash – TryHackMe Lab

# Overview

This repository contains my notes, solutions, and explanations from the Crack the Hash TryHackMe room. The lab focuses on identifying different hashing algorithms and using various techniques and tools to crack hashed values. Through this exercise, I explored multiple hash formats and learned how to use both manual and automated cracking methods effectively.

# Objectives

Recognize and identify different types of hash algorithms
Use online and offline tools to crack hashes
Understand the structure, characteristics, and complexity of hashing methods
Apply dictionary-based attacks, brute force, and specialized hash cracking tools
Strengthen understanding of password security and common vulnerabilities

# Key Learnings

Gained experience using tools such as Hash-Identifier, Hashcat, John the Ripper, and online lookup services
Learned how to analyze hash patterns to determine their type (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, NTLM, bcrypt, etc.)
Practiced performing dictionary attacks with wordlists such as rockyou.txt
Understood how salts and algorithm complexity impact the difficulty of cracking hashes
Developed a stronger understanding of why secure password practices and hashing policies are necessary
Crack the Hash

# Repository Structure

hashes.txt – List of cracked and uncracked hashes
methods.md – Explanation of tools and techniques used
screenshots/ – Images showing commands and cracking results
README.md – Documentation of the entire lab

# Purpose

This repository documents my approach and learning from the Crack the Hash room. It serves as a reference for beginners exploring hashing, password cracking, and cybersecurity fundamentals
